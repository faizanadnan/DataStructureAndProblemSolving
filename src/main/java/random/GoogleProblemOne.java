    Two closely-related codebases you maintain are being merged together into a single project. As part of that merge, you want to combine the
     CHANGELOG.txt from each project into a single CHANGELOG.txt
     which retains the release notes from both projects.

Each release in a changelog looks like:

    1.12.8
    ---------
    * Add a shiny new feature
    * Fix bug #1234567

or like:

    1.0.138
    ---------
    * Add an often-requested feature


The version number of each release is a semantic version number (semver). Releases in the merged changelog should be sorted by descending version number, so the latest release is at the top. Because of historical accident, you cannot assume the *input* changelogs are sorted correctly.

If both changelogs have a release with the same version number, the entries for that release should be merged into a single release entry. The bulleted list of release notes from the second projectâ€™s changelog should be appended to the bulleted list of notes from the first project for that release.
